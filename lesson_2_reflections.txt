What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	serve as a container folder to hold all the related files
	$ git init	 
 	$ git status 	#indicate no files are committed. Git will not do an initial commit for us, since then we would not have a chance to add some descriptions to it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Working directory  	->  Staging area  			-> Repository
filesystem directory	    Files related to a logical commit 	   All the files under "watch".
(visible in filesystem)		(recorded in .git folder)		(recorded in .git folder)
	staging area enable us to place files in a non-contiguous steps. So we don't need to commit in one breath but in a "step-by-step" fashion.
